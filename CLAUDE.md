## Feature Development Workflow

### Structured Feature Planning
When Claude Code encounters work that would benefit from structured planning, it will:
1. Detect complexity and suggest feature breakdown
2. Ask planning questions directly in chat
3. Generate organized feature and task structure
4. Provide individual copy/paste blocks for Linear/GitHub issues
5. Create organized files in .claude/features/

### Complexity Detection
Claude should suggest feature planning when requests involve:
- Multiple components (UI + API + database)
- External integrations or new infrastructure
- Complex UI with multiple views/states
- Estimated effort >5 story points or >3 days
- Cross-domain functionality
- Business logic or workflow automation

### Feature Planning Process

#### Step 1: Detection and Suggestion
When complex work is detected, respond:

"This appears to be feature-level work involving [specific complexity factors]. I can create a structured breakdown with individual copy/paste blocks for Linear and GitHub.

Would you like me to create a structured feature breakdown? I'll ask a few planning questions and generate organized tasks with ready-to-use issue content."

#### Step 2: Interactive Planning Questions
If user agrees, ask these questions **one at a time, waiting for each response**:

1. "**Feature Name**: What should we call this feature?"
2. "**User Story**: Complete this - 'As a [user type], I want [capability] so that [benefit]'"
3. "**Primary Domain**: Which domain? (cases/appointments/communications/auth/analytics/dashboard/mobile/other)"
4. "**Acceptance Criteria**: What are the key requirements? (List the main things it must do)"
5. "**Story Points**: Estimated complexity? (3/5/8/13/21)"
6. "**Dependencies**: Any technical or business dependencies?"
7. "**Priority**: Business priority? (Low/Medium/High/Critical)"

#### Step 3: Task Generation Logic
Based on the feature details, automatically generate appropriate tasks:

**Communication Features:**
- SMS features â†’ "SMS Integration", "SMS Scheduling", "Delivery Tracking"
- Email features â†’ "Email Templates", "Email Delivery", "Email Analytics"
- Push features â†’ "Push Setup", "Notification Preferences", "Real-time Delivery"

**Dashboard Features:**
- Dashboard mentions â†’ "Dashboard Components", "Data Integration", "Analytics Widgets"
- Reporting â†’ "Report Engine", "Export Functionality", "Scheduled Reports"

**Case Management:**
- Case workflow â†’ "Case State Management", "Assignment Logic", "History Tracking"
- Case search â†’ "Search Infrastructure", "Advanced Filtering", "Search Analytics"

**Appointment Features:**
- Booking â†’ "Calendar Integration", "Booking Flow", "Availability Management"
- Scheduling â†’ "Schedule Management", "Conflict Detection", "Reminder System"

#### Step 4: Generate Copy/Paste Content
After collecting information, provide individual copy/paste blocks in this exact format:

```

[Repeat for each generated task...]

#### Step 5: File Creation
After providing copy/paste content, create these files:

**.claude/features/[feature-slug]/feature.md**
**.claude/features/[feature-slug]/tasks/[task-slug].md** (for each task)
**.claude/features/[feature-slug]/copy-paste-content.md** (all content in one file)

Then show the file structure created and offer to create detailed implementation plans.

### Task Breakdown Templates

### Response Format Rules
- Always provide individual copy/paste blocks clearly separated
- Use consistent formatting for Linear vs GitHub
- Include appropriate labels and story points
- Reference the correct domain and file paths
- Provide both feature-level and task-level issues
- Create organized file structure
- Offer to create detailed implementation plans after breakdown

## Plan & Review

### Before starting work
- Always assess complexity and suggest feature planning when appropriate
- If feature planning is used, create both breakdown AND detailed implementation plan
- Write all plans to appropriate .claude/ locations
- Always ask for review before implementation

### While implementing
- Update both .claude/tasks/ files AND feature progress files
- Cross-reference between feature acceptance criteria and technical progress

### Key Refactoring Changes Made

#### 1. **Source Directory Structure**
- **NEW**: Added `src/` directory to separate source code from configuration
- **Improved**: Clear separation between app routing and reusable components
- **Benefit**: Better organization and easier navigation for large codebases

#### 2. **Route Groups Implementation**
- **NEW**: `app/(auth)/` for authentication routes
- **NEW**: `app/(dashboard)/` for protected dashboard routes
- **Benefit**: Better URL organization without affecting the actual URLs

#### 3. **Feature-Based Architecture**
- **Maintained**: `src/features/` with domain-driven design
- **Enhanced**: Each feature has its own components, hooks, lib, and types
- **Benefit**: Scalable architecture that grows with the application

#### 4. **Component Organization**
- **Consolidated**: All components now in `src/components/`
- **Categorized**: UI, forms, layout, landing, and shared components
- **Benefit**: Easier to find and maintain components

#### 5. **Provider Consolidation**
- **NEW**: `src/providers/providers.tsx` combines all context providers
- **Simplified**: Root layout now uses single `<Providers>` component
- **Benefit**: Cleaner root layout and easier provider management

#### 6. **TypeScript Path Mappings**
Updated `tsconfig.json` with comprehensive path mappings:
```json
{
  "paths": {
    "@/*": ["./*"],
    "@/src/*": ["./src/*"],
    "@/components/*": ["./src/components/*"],
    "@/lib/*": ["./src/lib/*"],
    "@/hooks/*": ["./src/hooks/*"],
    "@/store/*": ["./src/store/*"],
    "@/types/*": ["./src/types/*"],
    "@/providers/*": ["./src/providers/*"],
    "@/features/*": ["./src/features/*"]
  }
}
```

### Server Actions Architecture
All server actions are organized by domain in `/app/actions/` and re-exported through `/app/actions/index.ts`:

- **Authentication**: Sign in/up, password reset, user management
- **Cases**: CRUD operations for medical cases 
- **Appointments**: Appointment management and retrieval
- **Generations**: AI content generation from templates and transcriptions
- **Email**: Template-based email sending and React email components
- **Templates**: CRUD for content generation templates

**Import pattern**: `import { createCase, getCase } from "@/app/actions"`

### Updated Import Patterns

#### Old Import Patterns (Before Refactoring):
```typescript
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
import { createClient } from "@/utils/supabase/server"
import { useTranscription } from "@/hooks/use-transcription"
import { cn } from "@/lib/utils"
```

#### New Import Patterns (After Refactoring):
```typescript
import { Button } from "@/src/components/ui/button"
import { createClient } from "@/src/lib/supabase/server"
import { useTranscription } from "@/src/hooks/use-transcription"
import { cn } from "@/src/lib/utils"
```

### Database Schema
Uses Supabase with normalized schema including:
- `cases` - Medical cases with status/type enums
- `appointments` - Appointment scheduling
- `transcriptions` - Audio transcription storage
- `soap_notes` - Medical SOAP notes
- `generations` - AI-generated content
- `templates` - Content generation templates

Types are auto-generated from Supabase schema in `database.types.ts`.

### Key Features
- **Real-time transcription**: Deepgram integration for live audio-to-text
- **AI-powered content generation**: OpenAI integration for SOAP notes and medical documentation
- **Email system**: Template-based email with React Email components
- **Case management**: Complete medical case workflow
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with middleware protection

### State Management
- **Zustand store** (`/src/store/use-case-store.tsx`) manages:
  - Recording state and transcriptions
  - Case actions (recordings, SOAP notes)
  - Current case and appointment data
  - Microphone and connection states

### Infrastructure
- Terraform configuration for AWS Lambda deployment
- Scripts for build and deployment automation
- Supabase local development support

## Important Notes

### Development Guidelines
- Follow the new `src/` directory structure for all new components and utilities
- Use the updated import patterns with `@/src/` prefixes
- Organize new features in `src/features/[domain]/` with proper subdirectories
- Use route groups for organizing related pages without affecting URLs

### Build and Deployment
- All protected routes require authentication via middleware
- Audio transcription requires Deepgram API credentials
- AI features require OpenAI API configuration
- Email functionality requires SendGrid or Resend configuration
- Database types should be regenerated after schema changes using codegen commands

### Code Quality
- The project uses TypeScript strict mode
- ESLint and TypeScript errors are ignored during builds (configured in next.config.ts)
- All UI components use the `cn` utility function for conditional styling
- Components follow shadcn/ui patterns and conventions

This refactored architecture provides a solid foundation for scaling the OdisAI veterinary practice management platform while maintaining clean separation of concerns and following Next.js 15 best practices.
